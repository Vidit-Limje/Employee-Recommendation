# Employee Recommendation System

A backend system that recommends the most suitable employees for a project based on **skills, proficiency levels, experience, domain match, and availability**.

The system calculates a **weighted score** for each employee and returns the **top recommended candidates** for a given project.

This system helps automate that process by analyzing employee skillsets and project requirements to generate intelligent recommendations.

The recommendation score considers:

- Skill match
- Skill proficiency
- Experience
- Domain expertise
- Availability

# Tech Stack

- **FastAPI** – Backend API framework
- **PostgreSQL / Supabase** – Database
- **SQLAlchemy** – ORM for database interaction
- **Uvicorn** – ASGI server
- **Pydantic** – Data validation

# Features

- Employee CRUD operations
- Project CRUD operations
- Employee search by name
- Skill-based employee recommendation engine

# Recommendation Algorithm

Employee score is calculated using weighted factors:

| Factor | Weight |
|------|------|
| Skill Match | 60% |
| Experience | 25% |
| Domain Match | 10% |
| Availability | 5% |

Final Score:
Final Score = Skill Score + Experience Score + Domain Score + Availability Score

Top employees are ranked based on the **highest final score**.
